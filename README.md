# Project Setup

## Description

This project consists of a backend service built using Node.js, Apollo Server, and GraphQL, and a frontend application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The backend interacts with external APIs (e.g., NASA API) and provides data to the frontend through GraphQL endpoints. The frontend showcases a user-friendly interface for browsing Mars Rover images.
